# iResizer

### Image resizer for any image... though designed for Twitch's Sub Badges and Emote sizes.

Allows you to:

- Feed it any image of any size, it'll will convert it to the twitch sizes.
- Multiple image selection.
- Gets the original filename, then adds to it the sizes for emotes, so you'll know which file's which.
- It can read from the folder you're getting the images from, so you'll know where the images will be saved.
